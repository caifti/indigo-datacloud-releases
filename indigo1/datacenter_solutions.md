# Data Center Solutions

The INDIGO - DataCloud project is providing many new features/services for resource centers: 
* *Improved scheduling* for allocation of resources by the popular open source Cloud platforms. OpenStack and OpenNebula. This provides both better scheduling algorithms and support for spot-instances.
* Support for improved IaaS resource orchestration capabilities using standards  orchestration engines through the use of the TOSCA standard, for both OpenStack and OpenNebula.
* Improved QoS capabilities of storage resources for better support of high-level storage requirements, such as flexible allocation of disk or tape storage space and support for data life cycle.
* Improved and transparent support for Docker containers. This includes for example the introduction of native container support in OpenNebula.
