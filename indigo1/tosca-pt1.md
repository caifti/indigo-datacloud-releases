## Release Notes

The **TOSCA Parser** is an OpenStack project and licensed under Apache 2. It is developed to parse TOSCA Simple Profile in YAML. It reads the TOSCA templates and creates an in-memory graph of TOSCA nodes and their relationship.

The **[INDIGO TOSCA Types](https://github.com/indigo-dc/tosca-types/tree/v1.0.1)** repository  shows a YAML description of new types added in the INDIGO project to extend TOSCA Simple Profile in YAML Version 1.0 to add high level entities.
